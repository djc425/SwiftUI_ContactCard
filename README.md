# SwiftUI ContactCard
Practicing SwiftUI by building a single view contact card. 

This contact card is based off of the tutorial project provided by Angela Yu's iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp on Udemy. My goal for this project was to begin learning about SwiftUI. What I really enjoyed was the ability to see my layout come to life as I was typing it out. 

Below is a screenshot with my :mailbox_with_mail: and :iphone:
